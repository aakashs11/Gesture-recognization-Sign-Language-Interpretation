# Gesture Recognition using OpenCV and Deep CNN

## About the Project

Here we are extracting the images of the hand in Grayscale using absolute background subtraction in OpenCV. For that you have to select the histogram which suits the best. You might need to make some minute changes in the code for it to work on your machine.

## Problem Statement:

According to the National Association of the Deaf (NAD), 18 million people are estimated to be deaf in India. They can communicate among themselves using sign language  but having a conversation with others is a difficult task. 

Extensive work has been done on the American Sign Language(ASL) and by working on this project we want to get involved in the development of our own indigenous platform to translate Indo-Pakistani Sign Language into text/sound and enable these people to have an improved conversational experience. 

## Dataset can be found on

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tQuO_-lGpt9Qwxjp3F6rqF_k7P3_8Eef

Collection of 7 custom gestures, which can be further extended to add Indian Sign Language Vocabulary.

## File Description

[Add_Gesture.py](https://github.com/aakashsingh11/Sign-Language-Interpretation/blob/master/Add_Gesture.py): Run this file to add gestures. It can be used to add vocabulary in any sign language. Go into the file and change the name of the directory and make other appropriate changes.

[ResizeImages.py](https://github.com/aakashsingh11/Sign-Language-Interpretation/blob/master/ResizeImages.py): Run this file after Add_Gesture.py in order to resize the images so that it can be fed into the Convolution Neural Network designed using tensorflow. The network accepts 89 x 100 dimensional image.

[Train.py](https://github.com/aakashsingh11/Sign-Language-Interpretation/blob/master/Train.py): Run this file  to retrain the model using your custom dataset.

[Predictor.py](https://github.com/aakashsingh11/Sign-Language-Interpretation/blob/master/Predictor.py): Running this file opens up your webcam and takes continuous frames of your hand image and then predicts the class of your hand gesture in realtime.

## Architecture

### Background Ellimination 

After taking the average of 30 frames you can introduce your hand into the frame and save the histogram. This will effectively subtract the background and show only the black and white pixels.

### The Deep Convolution Neural Network

The network contains **7** hidden convolution layers with **Relu** as the activation function and **1** Fully connected layer.

The network is trained across **50** iterations with a batch size of **64**.

I kind of saw that 50 iterations kind of trains the model well and there is no increase in validation accuracy along the lines so that should be enough.

The model achieves an accuracy of **99.2%** on the validation dataset.

The ratio of training set to validation set is **1000 : 100**.

## How to run the RealTime prediction

Run the [Predictor.py](https://github.com/aakashsingh11/Sign-Language-Interpretation/blob/master/Predictor.py) and you will see a window named **Video Feed** appear on screen. Wait for a while until a window named **Thresholded** appears.

The next step involves pressing **"s"** on your keyboard in order to start the real-time prediction.

Bring your hand in the **Green Box** drawn inside **Video Feed** window in order to see the predictions.
Look in demo for some visual clarity.

## Demo of how things look on the go

Well now it's time for some demo.
